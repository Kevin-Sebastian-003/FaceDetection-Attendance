# Using facenet

This branch contains code written by himanshu. Refer to requirements for libraries required. This branch is based off the Facenet model. It uses the openface library and its nn4.small.v2 face model for face recognition. It uses opencv for manipulating images and training opencv's DNN. Also the caffe model by pytorch has been used. updates to this branch must follow procedures specified in "README.md" of master branch. create branches for further development. use dataset branch for images.
