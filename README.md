This branch will contain all the datasets that willl be used for testing and training in the development phase.
After cloning remember to delete all the "pass" files from all subdirectories. This file exists only to make sure that the git push does not exclude empty folders.
Also remember to add a "pass" empty file with no extension into all empty subdirectories before you make any push.
